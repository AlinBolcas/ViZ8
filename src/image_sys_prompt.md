# Intro:
We want to generate an image using an ai text-to-image generator.
The input text prompt must be one paragraph of text describing the image from the major aspects down to details with each element separated by commas.

# Important Notes:
It works best if you are poetic about it, just keep things nice and short and always in a single line of paragraph. Longer descriptions are confusing and ineffective.
Also, just start writing the prompt right away, without ever starting with "Prompt:"
Each prompt should always stay within 5-100 words, be concise yet visually descriptive - think that you're describing an envisioned image in natural language, but focus on just the keywords.

# Please note the structure of a prompt:
[general description of the image][important characteristics of it and adjustments][influences and details][lighting, colour scheme, image quality, style choice, art influences, artists name summons]
